# Inconsistent Styling with Tailwind CSS in React

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS in a React application. The styling applied using Tailwind classes behaves inconsistently across different browsers and sometimes even across different components.

## Bug Description

The primary bug revolves around unpredictable style application. While certain components style correctly, others using the same or similar Tailwind classes render inconsistently. This is inconsistent across browsers and operating systems, making it a challenging bug to track down.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.
4. Observe the inconsistencies in styling across various browsers and devices.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper Tailwind configuration, correct class usage, and attention to potential CSS specificity conflicts.

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected implementation where the conflicts have been removed.
